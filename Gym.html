                as a subject at school. Gymnasium is a large room with equipment for exercising the body and increasing
                strength or a club where you can go to exercise and keep fit.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-3">
                A gym is a gymnasium, also known as health club and fitness centre. Gymnasiums have moved away just
                being a location for gymnastics. Where they had gymnastics apparatus such as bar bells, parallel bars,
                jumping boards and running path etc.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-3">
                If you are looking to join a gymnastics club, please see gymnastics.</p>
            <p class="fs-3">
                A health club, fitness centre is now commonly referred to as a gym.</p>
            <h2>Choosing the right gym for you</h2>
            <p class="fs-3">
                Most gyms have a wide range of ages and levels of fitness. Don't buy into the preconception that it will
                be full of supreme athletes!
            </p>
            <h1>Costs</h1>
            <div class="carousel-inner">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="cost.jpg" alt="">
                <div class="container my-3"></div>
            </div>
            <p class="fs-3">
                Before joining any gym, it is highly recommended that you shop around and go on a visit before joining
                up. You should check joining options, no joining fee, pay-as-go, free trail periods, no joining fee,
                First month free, corporation discounts and off peak discounts. Avoid long term agreements which can tie
                you into an agreement for anything between 1-3 years!
            </p>
            <p class="fs-3">
                If you are looking for a specialised class - men only, woman only or seniors etc check the gym offers
                this. Gyms that do offer these tend to also have specialised programs for the target market. Aquasize
                classes for seniors by way of an example.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-3">
                During your tour you should ask about any special offers?
            </p>
            <p class="fs-3">
                How many members do they currently have? (As overcrowding can result in you waiting for equipment)
            </p>
            <p class="fs-3">
                What are the busy times? Try to avoid peak times as again you may have to wait for equipment.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-3">
                Also check equipment, Facilities and staff.
            </p>
            <h2>Induction day</h2>
            <p class="fs-3">
                It is important to arrange an induction day prior to you starting to use the gym. This is for your own
                safety, as misuse of equipment may not just leave you feeling embarrassed but could result in injury.
                Every gym will offer an induction day.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-3">
                Induction days vary from gym to gym, but should ideally include an initial 1-2-1 health and fitness
                consultation. Your instructor should familiarise you with all gym equipment. Some provide initial
                exercise programs and regular follow up consultations and reviews.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-3">
                It is important to choose a gym that facilitates for your needs, make sure the gym provides a clean,
                safe and friendly environment that you can fit into.
            </p>

                machines will have their own section.

                Facilities can vary greatly from gym to gym. Not just on a broad range of cardiovascular equipment
                including:
            </p>
            <p class="fs-3">
                Treadmills, Rowers, stationary bikes, cross trainers, versa climbers (step machines), steppers, and
                rowing machines.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-3">
                Resistance training equipment including:
            </p>
            <p class="fs-3">
                Fixed weight machines, dumbbells, barbells and weight plates.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-3">
                Also clean toilets, changing and shower rooms and exercise mats, stability balls and space to exercise.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-3">
                When choosing your gym you should check there is a number of the equipment you feel you will use more.
                If you are going to focus on free weight training (dumbbells etc) check they have multiple sets. On
                weight machines check they have setting from minimal weight to maximum weight to suit your capabilities.
                Also check have they been maintained and in good condition. If you are going to mainly use of cardio
                machines again check they have been well maintained, check they have adequate number of machines
                compared to gym members.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-3">
                Larger gyms also may have studio classes, sports and injury therapy. Sports shop, juice bars, cafe and
                restaurant. Swimming pool, sauna, Jacuzzi, steam rooms. Tennis, squash and badminton courts. Some gyms
                also offer child care facilities.
            </p>
            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p class="fs-3">
                You may want to take into account the distance from your home and or work. As the further away it is the
                less convenient it may become.
            </p>
            <h2>Opening hours</h2>
            <p class="fs-3">
                Many have different preferences for when they like to train from early birds at 7 and 7 am till late at
                night when the gyms empty and you have no distractions. Opening hours is again something you may need to
                consider depending on your other commitments, child care, working hours etc. Also check weekend opening
                hours. Gym opening and closing times vary greatly with some of the larger open 6am till 11pm. Some gyms
                are now 24 hours! Also check holiday open hours.
            </p>
            <h2>Staff</h2>
            <p class="fs-3">
                Members of staff do tend to be fit and healthy, smartly dressed in corporate clothing. They should be
                happy to explain and demonstrate whenever necessary. They should have knowledge across a wide range of
                exercise disciplines and many are also personal trainers. When you are on you initial visit look out for
                if the staff are helping and advising all members or only willing to advise clients who have paid for
                additional personal training session. You should check on staff qualifications and also view feedback
                from previous clients. Some memberships come with a specific training schedule designed to achieve your
                goals.
            </p>
            <h2>What are the benefits of going to a gym?</h2>
            <p class="fs-3">
                Regular exercise helps control weight when use with a balanced diet. Regular physical activity can help
                you prevent or manage a wide range of health problems and concerns, including stroke, metabolic
